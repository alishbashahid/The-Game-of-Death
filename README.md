# The Game of Death
## Overview

In this project, I have created a proof of concept for an extensible simulation framework that will be used to model the movement of humans within their habitats. This will be helpful to generate statistics on how the pandemic is spread with varying human behaviors.
The project is designed using Java as it is an object-oriented language that allows us to create modular programs and reusable code.

## Solution Design

The scope of this project includes:
- Problem Analysis
- Designing an object-oriented model
- Coding the object-oriented in model in Java
- Testing the solution
